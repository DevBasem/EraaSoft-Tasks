<p>Hello @Model.Name,</p>

<p>We received a request to reset your password for your MovieApp account. Use the verification code below to complete the process:</p>

<div class="otp-container">
    <div class="otp-code">@Model.OtpCode</div>
</div>

<p>Enter this code on the password reset page to verify your identity and create a new password.</p>

<div class="important-note">
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> This verification code will expire in 15 minutes for security reasons. If you did not request a password reset, please ignore this email or contact our support team.</p>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>For security reasons:</p>
<ul style="color: #e1e1e1; padding-left: 20px;">
    <li>Never share this code with anyone</li>
    <li>Our staff will never ask for this code</li>
    <li>Create a strong, unique password that you don't use elsewhere</li>
</ul>
